# Welcome

Welcome to the Documentation for Shortcut Library. An Slime Rancher Library for making SR Mods using C#, Visual Studio and the game itself obviously. If you would like to continue, just scroll down to get started!

**Resources you'll probably need:**

- [SRML Wiki]() (Go here to learn to setup your project, etc.)

- [FrostWiki]() (Definitely useful to know things about SR Modding, etc during all this.)

- [Secret Styles DLC]() (This is only required if you make Secret Styles.)

- [ShortcutLib]() (The library itself.)
