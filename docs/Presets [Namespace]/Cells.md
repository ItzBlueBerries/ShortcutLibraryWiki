# Cells

`NOTE: The Presets Namespace is simply just a namespace that has preset things.`

Same thing as the `Sizes` presets, but with cells! There could be plenty of random cells in here, but as of now there is only a few which are a cosmetic pod cell & a fountain cell.

```cs
public static readonly string COSMETIC_CELL = "zoneREEF/cellReef_GordoIsland/Sector/Loot/treasurePodCosmetic";
public static readonly string FOUNTAIN_CELL = "zoneREEF/cellReef_Intro/Sector/Resources/waterFountain01";
```

Of course you could also copy the cell it returns, but why do that when you can just use its variable? Up to you.
